                <p class="first">
                    As a seasoned Talent Management Analytics Professional with twenty-two years of experience, 
                    I am dedicated to enhancing employee morale, job satisfaction, and retention to drive organizational success. 
                    Currently, I work for the leading provider of Artificial Intelligence for the Department of Defense. 
                    By employing a strategic approach to career coaching, project placement, and hiring through qualitative assessments, 
                    I craft innovative analytical solutions that drive mission-critical advancements. My work ensures our nation's defense 
                    capabilities are not only at the forefront of technology but also continuously evolving to meet future challenges.
                </p>

                <p class="second">
                    Previously, with the United States Marine Corps, I leveraged predictive analytics to forecast performance trends 
                    and guide career development strategies. By implementing effective workforce planning and promoting diversity, 
                    I significantly improved client outcomes and achieved notable organizational successes, such as increasing the 
                    promotion and retention of women, a historical challenge for the Marine Corps. My adaptability and diverse skill 
                    set were key in driving these improvements and fostering an inclusive environment that values and promotes diversity.

                <p class="third">
                    My passion for driving effective change and developing innovative solutions for clients continued as a Talent Acquisition Manager. 
                    In this role, I redefined and evolved talent acquisition strategies, sourced and attracted top-tier talent, and built a strong 
                    employer brand. I strived to enhance the candidate experience and implemented cutting-edge technology to streamline the recruitment 
                    process. By taking a holistic approach to streamlining processes, I ensured that every aspect of talent management was seamlessly 
                    integrated, creating efficient and cohesive workflows. These efforts not only improved organizational outcomes but also fostered 
                    a more dynamic and supportive work environment.
